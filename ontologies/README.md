## Base ODP

For this select ontologies of cognitive biases, the ODP [Experience & Observation](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Experience\_%26\_Observation) as one of the base.

| Experience & Observation - Intent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| to represent the epistemological "missing link" between a cognitive activity, e.g. the interaction with a cultural object, and any evidence of the effects this activity has on the individuals that are engaged with it; what can collectively be considered as an experience. |

| <ol><li>In what ways can one person be engaged in a single activity?</li><li>What personal observations were produced by reflecting upon an activity being carried out?</li><li>Which activities performed by someone have prompted an observation from that person and which haven't?</li></ol> |

Evidently, all these elements can be used to the modeling of ontologies for cognitive biases. Base OWL file for this ODP can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eureadit/reading-experience-ontology/master/data-model-v2.owl). Moreover, here is the diagram that the ODP uses:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Diagram of Experience &#x26; Observation</p></figcaption></figure>

This diagram will be used as a guidance for the subsequent ontologies to customize, fitting to the appropriate bias ontology.

## List of Finished Ontologies

This page serves as a hub of the finished ontologies. Each sub-pages will detail the prompts for the LLM and its results, the resulting ontology the AI made that will be used as the base, and the semi-finished ontologies that has been aligned with the appropriate Framester Frames.

1. [Von Restorff effect](von-restorff-effect.md)
2. [Picture superiority effect](picture-superiority-effect.md)
3. [Self-relevance effect](self-reference-effect.md)
4. **Negativity bias**

These ontologies uses the specific ODP [Experience & Observation](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Experience\_%26\_Observation) as a base. In some of the ontology, the base ontology gets expanded further to accommodate the finished ontology of the cognitive biases.

_Note: The OWL files of each ontology can be found at the top of each subpages._
