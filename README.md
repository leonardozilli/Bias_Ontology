# üóí Documentation Overview

As one of the group responsible for the ongoing project for the **KRE (Knowledge Representation and Extraction)**, we have made this documentation to outline the progress that we are making as a group to contribute to the modeling of Cognitive Bias.

The group consists of **Evan Arnoldi**, **Leonardo Zili** and **Nicole Liggeri**. We found that our shared interest and urgency to finish the project as soon as possible gathered us in the group, and the progress we have made so far have been fruitful.&#x20;

## Cognitive Bias Codex

Cognitive bias is an interesting phenomenon that has been observed by various researchers. By definition, it is "systematic and universally occurring tendencies, inclinations, or dispositions that skew or distort information processes in ways that make their outcome inaccurate, suboptimal or simply wrong." (Korteling and Toet, 2020) \[[1](./#1.-korteling-j.-e.-and-toet-a.-2020-.-cognitive-biases-in-reference-module-inneuroscience-and-biobeh)]

In this project, we are tasked to make a new ontology based on various clusters of biases in the Cognitive Bias Codex, as seen in this graph:

<figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/Cognitive_bias_codex_en.svg" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Cognitive Bias Codex</p></figcaption></figure>

Out of 20 clusters in the codex, our group chose two specific cluster of biases that will be the base of an ontology that will be made from our comprehension. The chosen clusters are:

1. Bizarre, funny, visually striking, or anthropomorphic things stick out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things.\
   a. Bizarreness effect \
   b. Humor effect \
   c. Von Restorff effect \
   d. Picture superiority effect \
   e. Self-relevance effect \
   f. Negativity bias
2. We notice when something has changed.\
   a. Anchoring \
   b. Conservatism \
   c. Contrast effect \
   d. Distinction bias \
   e. Focusing effect \
   f. Framing effect \
   g. Money illusion \
   h. Weber-Fechner law

| Evan's Personal Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| <p>From these chosen clusters of cognitive biases, I would be working on the ontology of four biases in the first cluster, specifically:</p><p></p><p><strong>c. Von Restorff effect</strong> <br><strong>d. Picture superiority effect</strong> <br><strong>e. Self-relevance effect</strong> <br><strong>f. Negativity bias</strong></p> |

| Leonardo's Biases                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p><strong>1a. Bizarreness effect</strong> <br><strong>1b. Humor effect</strong> <br><strong>2a. Anchoring</strong> <br><strong>2d. Distinction Bias</strong></p><p><strong>2e. Focusing effect</strong> </p> |

With this in mind, we move on to the next phase of the documentation, which is **identifying** the steps needed.
