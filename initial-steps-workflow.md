# ðŸ‘Ÿ Initial Steps - Workflow

After sessions of tutoring and explanation from both **Prof. Aldo Gangemi** and **Stefano De Giorgis**, we identified the initial steps required to progress the project from a planning phase into an actual implementation.

## Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs)

The **Ontology Design Patterns** (**ODPs**) is the main 'skeleton' of our project as we will be modeling the previous chosen biases to create an ontology out of it.

By definition, Gangemi and Chaudhri (2009) \[[1](initial-steps-workflow.md#1.-gangemi-a.-and-chaudhri-v-k.-representing-the-component-library-into-ontology-design-patterns.-wo)] explained that ODPs "are reusable solutions for modeling ontologies, based on good practices". Therefore, we have an understanding that the project requires us to reuse ODPs into our ontologies.

We researched a number of ODPs [here](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Main\_Page), and found some that is quite suitable for our biases to use. However, this will also lead to some problems on our end, which will be detailed in the problems assessment.

## eXtreme Design Methodology

We identified the steps towards eXtreme Design's methodology as one of the feasible steps we can take to progress the project, which consist of several tasks:

Summarily, the process can be explained in 4 steps (Thanks to Stefano De Giorgis):

* Identify the requirements for the ontology design process and formulate a set of competency questions (CQ) that the ontology should be able to answer;
* Assess whether existing Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) from the Content ODPs repository2 meet the modeling requirements and can be reused;
* Validate the ontology modules through error provocation, inference testing, and validation for each module in the ontology network;
* Integrate the modeled and tested ontologies into a closure module and populate them with domain entities from knowledge graphs.

By participating in the project, we already identified the project context and the requirement for us to achieve in order to finish the project of modeling the Cognitive Bias.

Then, we progressed into the proceeding tasks to collect requirement stories, which we identify as a task for us to write stories which showcase the biases in a real-life situation.

As suggested by the supervisors of our project, we decided to collect these requirement stories by using the help of Artificial Intelligence to process the definition of the biases and create user stories out of the definitions.

However, we took a step further by reading bibliographies of the biases that each of us have chosen, and gave the definition to ChatGPT in order for the AI to formulate scenarios that we can use for our ontology.

Therefore, here are our initial workflow in defining the ontology:

1. We read select bibliographies of the bias that we are looking to implement its ontology, and then inputted the definition to ChatGPT.
2. After inputting the definition, we asked the AI to formulate user stories and identify which scenarios are proper for us to use in our ontologies.
3. Then, with the previous scenario, we asked the AI to create a basic ontology which consists of Classes and Properties for us to use as an inspiration for our own ontologies.

With the steps identified, we continue to progress our project, which evidently would be hindered by problems as well.
