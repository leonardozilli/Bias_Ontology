# ðŸ’¡ Reflections

After working on the project, we've found several reflections about several things that we've encountered during the project:

### LLM Usage

* LLM (ex: ChatGPT) is a powerful tool which require moderation in usage, but when utilized properly, can save up a **lot** of time.
* Although LLM appears to be a superior search engine with chatbot functionality at first, closer inspection reveals that its answers are rather unreliable, requiring constant checking from the user to validate the information.

### Cognitive Biases & Ontology Development

* The cognitive biases are different but similar with each other in a way. Developing an ontology to include them in one ontology instead of making an ontology for each is a possibility.
* With abovementioned points, the ontology of the biases are also interchangeable, as in two biases or more can inhabit the same ontology using the same terms (Example: Von Rostorff and Picture Superiority both uses the same ontology, utilizing the same Classes and Properties, with the difference being the described Individuals).
* Making a diagram before creating an ontology will smooth over the progress due to the clarity it brings.
* Flexibility is crucial when developing an ontology. However, the flexibility does not mean that there are no set of rules or guidelines to be followed.
* When both flexibility and guideline are used properly and concurrently, the result became much more satisfactory.

| <p>I generally found the project both challenging and enlightening. Developing ontologies from scratch is quite a daunting task, more so when given the flexibility to decide the classes, properties, and individuals ourselves. At the beginning, doubts were evidently clouding our thoughts, making it hard to progress at a meaningful pace for our project. However, as time went on and after several consultations, I personally found that the project was challenging in an exciting way, rather than tedious.</p><p></p><p>Although I am not yet sure how the previous ontologies would fare in terms of proper ontology creation, I hope that they reflect my enthusiasm in creating my own ontologies for cognitive biases. Furthermore, these ontologies can hopefully also contribute to the progress of ontology creation for cognitive biases, which I assume to be the purpose of the final project in this course.</p><p></p><p>As Prof. Gangemi said before: <em>the more you wrong, the more you learn.
